Since there aren't any releases yet, you need to install the source, install Love2D and run the source with Love2D. (not recommended)
<br>
Instructions are below:
<br>
<br>
Mac: (copy and paste the whole thing into terminal)
<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/isums/pudding.git
cd pudding
bash macinstall.sh
```
Now you should be able to play it by using `love .` (you have to be in the directory)
<br>
Every time you open terminal you need to run `cd pudding && love .` to play the game.
